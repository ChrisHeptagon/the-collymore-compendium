A parabola is the shape formed by a quadratic equation, and the points that make up a parabola have a certain property that always makes them equidistant or *(equal in distance)* from a line called a Directrix (*A constant line on a graph Ex: $y=0$, $y=-6$*), and a point called a focus *(A singular point on a graph that always has the same x-value as the vertex, and is as far away from the vertex as the Directrix)*.

## Model Example 1

When the focus and the directrix of a parabola is stated in a problem, the parabola's equation could be determined. Take for instance, a parabola with a focus at $(4,-1)$, and a directrix where $y=-5$. The parabola's equation could be determined by first determining the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of the parabola could be determined by using the equal distance property of the focus and the directrix through dividing the distance between the two in half, resulting in a value $p$, which is an important value in this problem ( the $p$ value represents the distance between the vertex and the parabola's focus and directrix, which will appear in an important equation for the parabola called *conic form* later).

For this parabola, the vertex would be located at point $(4,-3)$, and the value of $p$ would be equal to 2.

The value of $p$ would be a postive value if the focus point is above the directrix, and a negative value if the focus point is below the directrix. Keep in mind that since the value of $p$ is a positive value, the parabola would be open above the directrix, or generally open upwards on the graph; but if the value of $p$ was negative, the parabola would be open below the directrix, or generally open downwards on the graph.

Now that the vertex was determined, it is now possible for the h and k value to be inputted into the equation for the conic form of a parabola, which is $(x-h)^2= 4p(y-k)$, where $h$ is equal to the x value of the vertex, and $k$ is equal to the y value of the vertex. When inputted, the result is the equation $(x-4)^2 = 4p(y+3)$. The next step is to also input the value of $p$ into the previous equation and further simplify this equation. You should get $(x-4)^2 = 8y+24$. The next step is to conduct inverse operations to get the value of $y$, by dividing both sides by $8$ and subtracting $24$, and if you should get the final answer of $\frac{1}{8}(x-4)^2 - 3$.

## Model Example 2                                                                       

In this scenario, there is a parabola with a focus at point $(-2,5)$, and a directrix at line $y=9$. The first step would be determining the vertex of the parabola by getting the distance between the focus and directrix and dividing it by two, which would be $2$ units. But, since the focus point is below the directrix, the value of $p$ would actually be negative; So the value of $p$ would be $-2$. Thus, the vertex would be point $(-2,7)$. Then the $(h,k)$ and $p$ values have to be inputted into the conic form equation (which is $(x-h)^2= 4p(y-k)$), and should look like this:                                                                               

$(x+2)^2 = 4(-2)(y-7)$. After simplifying this equation using inverse operations, the final answer would be $-\frac{1}{8} (x+2)^2 + 7 = y$.
