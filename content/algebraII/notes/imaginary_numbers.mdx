There are many types of numbers found within Mathematics, one of them being imaginary numbers. The letter $i$ in Algebra II is used to represent imaginary numbers. 

The letter $i$ is a constant equal to the square root of $1$ or $\sqrt{-1}$. The purpose of imaginary numbers is to make it possible for Mathematicians to solve equations that revolve around negative roots. For example, in an equation such as $x^2 + 1 = 0$, it would be impossible to solve without the usage of the letter $i$. After taking into account the constant of $i$ in the equation, an answer could be determined. The answer being $x = \pm i$

Since $i$ is equal to a value that is not a real number, it has a different way of being evaluated in Mathematics. For instance, the powers of $i$ follow a cycle as to what their value would be.

The cycle goes as follows:                              

1. $i^0 = 1$                             

2. $i^1 = \sqrt{-1}$ or $i$                             

3. $i^2 = -1$                             

4. $i^3 = -i$                             

5. $i^4 = 1$                                                          

The pattern repeats until infinity.

## Model Example 1                                                           

To solve $i^{100}$ you first have to divide the exponent $^{100}$ by the number 4 and take the remainder of the division and place it as the exponent of $i$ (This is done due to the fact that integer exponents of $i$ can only take 4 values and cycle every 4 numbers). When the remainder is place as the exponent of $i$, the answer would be $i^0$ or $1$.                                                          

## Model Example 2                                                          

To solve $\sqrt{-200}$ you first have to break apart the square root into two parts $\sqrt{200}$ and $i$ (which remember is equal to $\sqrt{-1}$). Then simplify the radical containing $200$, which would result in $10\sqrt{2}$ and the final step is to multiply the simplified expression by $i$. The final answer should be $10i\sqrt{2}$

To solve $(5i)^2$, you first have to square both $5$ and $i$, $5$ squared is $25$ and $i$ squared is $-1$. The final step is to multiply the two values together, and the final answer is $-25$.
