Base: Within an exponential expression, the base is the number being raised to an exponent. For example, in the expression $6^x$, $6$ is the base.

Binomial: A polynomial with two terms combined with either a $+$ or a $-$ sign. For example, the expression $2x + 5$ is a binomial.

Coefficient: The number that multiplies a variable in an expression. In the expression $5x^2$, the coefficient of the term, $x^2$  is $5$.

Complex Number: A number in the form $a + bi$, where both $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is an imaginary number. For example, $5 + 3i$ is a complex number.

Constant: A term in a polynomial that has no variable tied to it. For example, in the polynomial $2x + 3$, the constant is $3$.

Difference of perfect squares: A strategy of factoring a polynomial. For example, using this strategy, $x^2 - 3^2$ turns into into $(x - 3)(x + 3)$. Using this strategy, a polynomial expression in the form of $a^2-b^2$ can be factored into $(a-b)(a+b)$.

Directrix: Every point found on a parabola is equidistant from a point and a line, and that line is called the directrix.

Elimination method: A method for solving systems of equations, where they are multiplied by a constant and then adding the equations in the system in a manner that makes one of the variables cancel out. Using this method, the system $x + 2y = 5$ and $3x - 2y = 7$ becomes $4x = 12$ when the two equations are added together.

Factor by grouping: A method of factoring that involves separating a polynomial into two or more groups, finding a common factor in each group, and, if possible, factoring a common factor out of what remains. For example, take the expression: $x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 6$ turns into $x^2(x + 3) + 2(x + 3)$ and turns into $(x + 3)(x^2 + 2)$.

Factoring: Locating two factors whose product is either a given polynomial or number. For example, the number, $15$ can be factored into $3*5$. Additionally, the polynomial, $x^2 - 5x + 6$ can be factored into $(x-2) (x-3)$.  

Focus: Every point on a parabola is equidistant from a point and a line, and the point is termed the focus of the parabola.

FOIL: A method of multiplying a binomial by another binomial. When multiplying $(2x + 3)(4x + 5)$, F (for firsts) represents $2x*4x$, O (for outers) represents $2x*5$, I (for inners) represents $3*4x$, and L (for lasts) represents $3*5$.

$i$: A constant representing the imaginary value of $\sqrt{-1}$  

Imaginary number: A number that is a multiple of the imaginary unit $i$. For example, $5i$ is an imaginary number.

Perfect square trinomial: A polynomial of the form $x^2 + 2ax + a^2$ or $x^2 - 2ax + a^2$ that can be factored into $(x + a)^2$ or $(x - a)^2$. For example, $x^2 + 6x + 9$ can be factored into $(x + 3)^2$.

Polynomial: An expression like $2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 7$ that is made up of one or more terms.  

![d](/images/polynomial_example.png)   

Quadratic Equation: An equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.  

Quadratic Formula: The formula $x=\frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ used to find the solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.  

Simplified Radical Form: When the number inside a radical sign has no factors that are perfect squares (or perfect cubes).

Standard form of a quadratic equation: $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.  

Substitution method: A system of equations where one of the variables is solved in terms of the other variable and then substituted into the other equation. For example, in the system of equations $y = 2x + 1$ and $3x + 2y = 10$, the $y$ in the second equation can be replaced by $2x + 1$ to become $3x + 2(2x + 1) = 10$.

Trinomial: A polynomial with three terms. For example, the expression $x^2 + 5x + 6$ is a trinomial.

Vertex form of a quadratic equation: An equation of the form $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$. When graphed, it is a parabola with its vertex at point $(h, k)$.
