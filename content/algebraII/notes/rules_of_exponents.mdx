When dealing with exponents in Algebraic there are certain rules to keep in mind.

## Model Example 1

Product of powers rule: When two or more terms with the same base number are multiplied with each other, the exponents are added between all the terms.

$5^2 * 5^3 = 5^5$ is equal to $5*5*5*5*5 = 3125$.

## Model Example 2

Quotient of powers rule: When dividing two or more terms with the same base number exponents, the base stays the same, but the exponent values are subtracted.

$4^5\div4^3=4^2$ is equal to $4*4 = 16$.

## Model Example 3

Power of a power rule: When dealing with two or more terms that have an exponent raised to another exponent, multiply the exponents together in the equation in question whilst keeping the base constant.

$(2^4)^4 = 2^{16}$ is equal to $65536$

## Model Example 3

Power of a product rule: When dealing with two or more terms that are being raised to the same exponent, only multiply the exponent by each of the terms. For example $(x * y)^3 = x^3 y^3$ and

$(x^2 * y^2)^3 = x^6 y^6$.

## Model Example 5

Zero power rule: Anytime where a number is raised to the power of zero, it is equal to one.

For example, $3^0 = 1$

## Model Example 6

Power of a quotient rule:

In short, a quotient is a result of dividing two numbers and could be represented through a fractions, with the number being divided being the numerator, and the number that the prior number is being divded by being the denominator. The exponent, in a similar fashion to the power of a product rule, must be placed once all the values within the parentheses next to the exponent.

For example, $(2/3)^4 = \frac{2^4}{3^4}$

## Model Example 7

Negative exponent rule:

When a negative exponent is on a number, convert the number into a reciprocal and make the exponent positive instead of negative.

Reciprocals are fractions that have a reversed numerator and denominator compared to a given  fraction. For example, $\frac{3}{5}$ turns into $\frac{5}{3}$. To make a number a reciprocal, first turn the number into a fraction by putting it over one (Like this $\frac{7}{1}$). Next, reverse the denominator and the numerator of the fraction.

For example, $x^{-2} = \frac{1}{x^2}$

## Model Example 8

Fractional exponent rule:

When an exponent is a fraction, it always corresponds to a radical expression. The denominator of the fractional exponent becomes the index or the root of the radical expression and the numerator of the fractional exponent becomes the exponent on the number located under the radical sign.

For example, $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ to $\sqrt[2]{3^1}$ to $\sqrt{3}$
