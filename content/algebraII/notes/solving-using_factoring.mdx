Quadratic equations can be solved using many methods including by factoring.                                                          

Steps to solve quadratic equations by factoring:                                                          

Step 1. Make sure the equation is written in standard form ($y=ax^2+bx+c$)                                                          

Step 2. Factor the polynomial.                                                          

Step 3. Set each factor equal to zero.                                                          

Step 4. Solve each of the resulting equations for $x$.                                                           

## Model Example 1                                                          

Solve the equation $x^2 + 5x = 24$ through factoring.                                                          

Step 1. Convert the equation into standard form. In this case, subtract $24$ from both sides of the equation.                                                          

Result: $x^2+5x-24=0$                                                          

Step 2. Factor the trinomial.                                                          

Result: $(x+8)(x-3)=0$                                                          

Step 3: Make each factor (the expression inside the parenthesis) separate and equal to $0$.                                                          

Result: $x+8=0$ and $x-3=0$                                                          

Step 4. Solve these resulting equations for $x$                                                          

Final Result: $x=-8$ and $x=3$                                                          

## Model Example 2                             

Solve the equation $9x^2 + 12 = 3 + 12x + 5x^2$ through factoring.                                                          

Step 1. Convert the equation into standard form. In this case subtract the terms $5x^2$, $12x$, and $3$ from both sides of the equation.                                                          

Result: $4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$                                                          

Step 2. Factor the trinomial.                                                          

Result: $(2x-3)(2x-3)$                                                          

Step 3: Make each factor (the expression inside the parenthesis) separate and equal to $0$.                                                          

Result: $2x-3=0$                                                          

Step 4. Solve these resulting equations for $x$                                                          

Result: $x = \frac{3}{2}$                                                                                       

## Model Example 3                             

Solve the equation $3x^2 = 4 - 11x$ through factoring.                                                          

Step 1. Convert the equation into standard form. In this case subtract $4$ and add $11x$ from both sides of the equation.                                                          

Result: $3x^2 + 11x - 4 = 0$                                                          

Step 2. Factor the trinomial.                                                          

Result: $(3x-1)(x+4)=0$                                                          

Step 3: Make each factor (the expression inside the parenthesis) separate and equal to $0$.                                                          

Result: $3X-1=0$ and $x+4=0$                                                          

Step 4. Solve these resulting equations for $x$                                                          

Result: $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=-4$
