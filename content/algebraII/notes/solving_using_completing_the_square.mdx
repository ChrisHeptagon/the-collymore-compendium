Quadratic equations can be solved using many methods including by completing the square. Using the complete the square method, it is necessary to add or subtract terms on both sides of the equation until the result is a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equation.

There is an important property to keep in mind with solving quadratics, and that is the square root property, which states that if $x^2 = a$ then $x = \sqrt{a}$ or $-\sqrt{a}$.

## Model Example 1

Solve the equation $x^2 + 4x +1 = 0$ using the complete the square method.

Step 1. Add or Subtract the constant term to the right side of the equal sign.

Result: $x^2 + 4x = -1$

Step 2. Divide the b term by $2$ and square it.

Result: $\frac{4}{2}= 2$ to $2^2 = 4$

Step 3. Add the squared number to both sides of the equation and simplify the side that has only one term.

Result: $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 3$

Step 4. The left hand side of the equation should be factored to become a perfect square.

Result: $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 3$ to $(x+2)^2 = 3$

Step 5. Simplify both sides of the equation by finding the square root of both sides.

Result: $\sqrt{(x+2)^2} = \sqrt{3}$ to $x+2 = \sqrt{3}$

Step 6. Further simplify the equation by subtracting $2$ from both sides.

Result: $x+2 = \sqrt{3}$ to $x = \sqrt{3} - 2$

Step 7. Since quadratic equations have two solutions (one negative and one positive) if the Square Root property is true, there has to be one positive equation and negative equation.

Final Result: $x=-2+\sqrt{3}$ or $x=-2-\sqrt{3}$.

## Model Example 2

Solve the equation $4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 0$ using the complete the square method.

Step 1. Divide the both sides of the equation by the coefficient.

Result: $x^2 + 5x + 25/4 = 0$

Since the left side of the equation is already a perfect square trinomial. The equation can be factored to be a perfect square binomial.

Like this: $(x+\frac{5}{2})^2=0$

Step 2. Find the square root of both sides. (Note that the Square Root property doesn't apply).

Result: $x + \frac{5}{2} = 0$

Step 3. Isolate $x$ to finally find the solution to the equation.

Final Result: $x = -\frac{5}{2}$

## Model Example 3

Solve the equation $x^2+4x = -21$ using the complete the square method.

Step 1. Divide $4$ by $2$ and then square it.

Result: $x^2 + 4x + (\frac{1}{2}*4)^2 = -21$

Step 2. Add $4$ to both sides of the equation.

Result: $x^2 + 4x + 4 = -21 + 4$ then to $x^2 + 4x + 4 = -17$

Step 3. Factor the perfect square trinomial and state it as a squared binomial.

Result: $(x+2)^2 = -17$

Step 4. Find the square root of both sides (the square root property applies so, there is a plus-or-minus symbol,   $\pm$)

Result: $x+2 = \pm \sqrt{-17}$

Step 5. Factor $i$ or $\sqrt{-1}$ out of $\sqrt{-17}$.

Result: $x+2=\pm \sqrt{17}*1$

Step 6. Remove $2$ from both sides of the equation through inverse operations.

Result: $x=-2\pm\sqrt{17}*i$

Step 7. Since quadratic equations have two solutions (one negative and one positive) if the Square Root property is true, there has to be one positive equation and negative equation.

Positive: $x=-2 + \sqrt{17}*i$

Negative: $x=-2 - \sqrt{17}*i$

Final Result: $x=-2 + \sqrt{17}*i$ and $x=-2 - \sqrt{17}*i$
