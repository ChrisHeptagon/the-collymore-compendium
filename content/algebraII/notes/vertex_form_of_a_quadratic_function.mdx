The equation for the vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$. $a$ represents the vertical stretch factor (if it is a negative value, the parabola opens downward, and if it is a positive value, the parabola will open upwards). $h$ represents the $x$ value of the vertex (and the quadratic's axis of symmetry) and $k$ represents the $y$ value of the vertex.

In order to convert $y=ax^2+bx+c$ or standard quadratic form to vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, it is required to complete the square.

## Model Example 1

Convert the equation $y = 2x^2-4x+5$ from standard form to vertex form, ($y=a(x-h)^2+k$), and state the vertex of the parabola.

Step One. To complete the square of the equation, isolate the terms $x^2$ and $x$ by doing inverse operations, or in this case subtracting $5$ from both sides of the equation.

Result: $y-5=2x^2-4x$                                                                              

Step Two. Since a leading coefficient of $1$ is necessary for completing the square, so the current leading coefficient of $2$ needs to be factored out.

Result: $y-5=2(x^2-2x)$

Step Three. Create a perfect square trinomial by keeping $y$ and adding the $2$ from the other side of the equation, so that both sides of the equation could be equal; find the missing value for both sides of the equation by dividing the coefficient by $2$ and squaring it, then multiply the number equivalent to the coefficient by the previous number, and also adding the squared value to the inside of the parenthesis.

Result: $y-5+(2*1) = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1)$

Step Four. Simplify both sides of the equation, then convert the right side of the equation to a perfect square in parenthesis multiplied by the leading coefficient.

Result: $y-3=2(x-1)^2$

Step Five. Isolate $y$, by doing inverse operations on the left side of the equation, or in this case adding $3$ to both sides of the equation.

Result: $y=2(x-1)^2 + 3$

Final Answer: $y = 2(x-1)^2 + 3$ and Vertex: (1,3) (The value of h is negative and the value of k is positive).

## Model Example 2

Convert the equation $y = -3(x+1)^2 - 6$ from vertex form to standard form, ($y=a(x-h)^2+k$).

Step One. Expand the square, $(x-h)^2$ to $(x-h)(x+h)$

Result: $-3(x+1)(x+1)-6$ to $-3(x^2 + 2x + 1) - 6$

Step Two. Distribute the variable $a$.                                                                              

Result: $a = -3$ to $y=-3x^2 - 6x - 3 - 6$                                                                              

Step Three. Combine any like terms present in the prior step.                                                                               

Final Result: $y=-3x^2-6x-9$
