Radical expressions are expressions that have radicals. Examples include $\sqrt{16}$, $\sqrt{64}$, and $\sqrt[3]{250x^4y}$.

Radical expressions could be broken apart into their factors into further simplified radical expressions.

For example, $\sqrt{100}$ can be broken apart to $\sqrt{10} * \sqrt{10}$, (Keep note that 100 is a perfect square, meaning that $10^2$ is is equal to $100$)

Additionally, $\sqrt{75}$ can be broken apart to $\sqrt{25} * \sqrt{3}$

## Model Example 1
### Simplify the Radical $\sqrt{63}$

Since $63$ is not a perfect square, it cannot be simplified into an integer, so $63$ has to be broken up into a set of factors with at least one of the numbers being a perfect square. In this example $63$ can be broken apart into $7$ and $9$, with $9$ being the perfect square. Now, write these factors inside of a radical symbol like this: $\sqrt{7}$ *$\sqrt{9}$. Next, take the square root of $9$ which is $3$ and place it in front of $\sqrt{7}$ due to the fact that when $\sqrt{7}$ and $3$ are multiplied together, the result is equal to $\sqrt{63}$.

Thus, the final answer is $3\sqrt{7}$.

## Model Example 2

### Simplify the Radical $\sqrt{a^3 b^5 c^2}$

First, factor the expression to split the variables into even and odd exponents.

For this example, $\sqrt{a^2*a^1*b^4*b^1*c^2}$

Then, reformat $b^4$ as $(b^2)^{2}$ using the power of a power rule of exponents.

For this example, $\sqrt{a^2*a^1*(b^2)^2*b^1*c^2}$

Separate the squared factors into individual radicals.

For this example, $\sqrt{a^2}*\sqrt{(b^2)^2}*\sqrt{c^2}*\sqrt{a*b}$

Find the square root of each radical expression.

For this example, the previous expression turns into $a*c*b^{2}*\sqrt{a*b}$

Simplify further to get the following final answer: $acb^2\sqrt{ab}$

## Model Example 3

### Simplify the Radical $\sqrt{9{{x}^{6}}{{y}^{4}}}$

Factor to find pairs of factors or exponents.

For this example, $\sqrt{3*3*x^3*x^3*y^2*y^2}$

Then reformat the pairs as perfect squares.

For this example, $\sqrt{3^2*(x^3)^{2}*(y^2)^{2}}$

Separate the squared factors into individual radicals.

For this example, $\sqrt{3^2}*\sqrt{(x^{3})^2}*\sqrt{(y^{2})^2}$

Further Simplify by removing the exponents to get the final answer of:

$3x^3 y^2$

## Model Example 4

### Simplify the Radical $-\sqrt{-72}$

Use the rule $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}$ to reformat the radical using the definition of $i$ which is equal to $\sqrt{-1}$

For this example, $-\sqrt{-72}$ would turn into $-\sqrt{72*-1}$ and then $\sqrt{72}\sqrt{-1}$.

Since 72 is not a perfect square, it is necessary to reformat it using factors that are perfect squares. Notice that 72 has three perfect squares as factors: 4, 9, and 36. It's best to use the largest factor that is a perfect square.

For this example, $-\sqrt{72}\sqrt{-1}$ would turn into $-\sqrt{36}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{-1}$ and then $-6\sqrt{2}\sqrt{-1}$.

The use the algebraic meaning of $i$ to reformat $\sqrt{-1}$ as $i$

For this example, $-6\sqrt{2}\sqrt{-1}$ would turn into $-6\sqrt{2}*i$ and then $-6i\sqrt{2}$.

The final answer is $-6i\sqrt{2}$.

## Model Example 5

### Simplify the Radical $\sqrt[4]{81{{x}^{8}}{{y}^{3}}}$

Reformat the expression to separate the terms into separate radicals.

For this example, $\sqrt[4]{81}*\sqrt[4]{x^8}*\sqrt[4]{y^3}$

Factor each radical term.

For this example, $\sqrt[4]{3*3*3*3}*\sqrt[4]{x^2*x^2*x^2*x^2}*\sqrt[4]{y^3}$

Simplify further, For this example, $\sqrt[4]{3^4}*\sqrt[4]{(x^2)^4}*\sqrt[4]{y^3}$ to $3*x^2 * \sqrt[4]{y^3}$.

Thus the answer is $3x^2\sqrt[4]{y^3}$.
