Linear and quadratic systems are systems of equations that consist of a linear equation and a quadratic equation.

A linear equation looks like: $y = x - 3$ and a quadratic equation looks like: $y = x^2 + 4$

<DesmosGraph divID="fsdsgdg" equations={['y = x - 3', 'y= x^2 + 4']}/>

A linear and quadratic system is often shown as a line and a parabola on a graph. At each point where the line and parabola intersect, is a solution to the equation system.

For instance, the linear and quadratic system shown below has two points that are solutions (where the quadratic and linear equation intersect)

In a Linear-Quadratic equation system, the two equations on a graph can never intersect, or intersect once, or at most intersect twice. Thus, Linear-Quadratic equation systems can only have none, one or two solutions.

When solving a Linear-Quadratic equation system, the main objective is to somehow combine the two equations into one with a single variable. The first step for combining the equations is to substitute the $y$ value in one of the equations with the other expression.

## Model Example 1

Take these two equations for instance: $y â€‹= x + 1$ and $y = x^2 - 1$

Within a given system of equations,  all of the equations are equal to each other. Thus, in this case, the Algebraic statement $x+1= x^2-1$ would be true.

Now it's possible for this equation to be solved, by solving the quadratic side for x for this example, with the next step being rewriting this equation in Quadratic form (Which is $ax^2 + bx + c$).

First, subtract $1$ and $x$ from both sides of the equation. You should get $0 = x^2 - x - 2$

The next step is to factor $0 = x^2 - x - 2$ by finding which numbers multiply to $c$ or $-2$ and add up to $b$ or $-1$. In this instance, the numbers that fit these requirements are $-2$ and $1$.

Now, the value of $x$ can be determined; by plugging in these values into the expression $(x+a)(x+b)$ and solving for $x$ within these two expressions individually. The two $x$ values that should be determined if done correctly, are $x = 2$ and $x = -1$.

Now, the value of $y$ can be determined; by plugging in the $x$ values into one of the expressions from the beginning of this example, in this case $y = x + 1$. The resulting $y$ value from $x = 2$ is $3$, and the resulting $y$ value from $x = -1$ is $0$.

Thus, the two points of solution in this system of equations are $(2,3)$ and $(-1,0)$

## Model Example 2

In this Linear-Quadratic equation system, there are two equations $y = x$ and $y = x^2 - 6$

First, substitute the $y$ value for one of the expressions with the other expression in the system. The equation should now look something like this: $x = x^2 - 6$.

Next, remove $x$ from both sides of the equation. Result: $0 = x^2 - x - 6$

Next, factor $0 = x^2 - x - 6$, by finding which numbers multiply to $c$ or $-6$ and add up to $b$ or $-1$. In this instance, the numbers that fit these requirements are $-3$ and $2$ (keep in mind the Quadratic equation $(ax^2 + bx + c)$).

Now, the value of $x$ can be determined; by plugging in these values into the expression $(x+a)(x+b)$ and solving for $x$ within these two expressions individually. The two $x$ values that should be determined if done correctly, are $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.

Now, the value of $y$ can be determined; by plugging in the $x$ values into one of the expressions from the beginning of this example, in this case $y = x$. The resulting $y$ value from $x = 3$ is $3$, and the resulting $y$ value from $x = -2$ is $-2$.


Thus, the two points of solution in this system of equations are $(3,3)$ and $(-2,-2)$.
