# Introduction to Chemistry

## What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. Chemistry is a very broad field of study, and it is divided into many different branches. The five main branches of chemistry are:

**Organic Chemistry** - the study of carbon containing chemicals.

**Inorganic Chemistry** - the study of non-carbon containing chemicals.

**Physical Chemistry** - the study of the behavior of matter and associated energy changes.

**Analytical Chemistry** - the study of the composition and components of matter.

**Biochemistry** - the study of the chemical processes that occur in living organisms.

## What are the Three Domains of Chemistry?

The three domains of chemistry are:

**Macroscopic** - the study of matter on a large scale. 

**Microscopic** - the study of matter on a small scale. 

**Symbolic** - the study of matter using symbols.

## What is the differences between pure and applied research?

**Pure Research** - research that is done for the sake of knowledge and understanding. Pure research is not done with a specific application in mind.

**Applied Research** - research that is done with a specific application in mind. Applied research is done to solve a problem or to develop a new product.

## How is modeling used in chemistry?

Modeling is used in chemistry to explain experimental results in manner that is easier to understand. Models are used to explain the behavior of matter and energy on a macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic level.
