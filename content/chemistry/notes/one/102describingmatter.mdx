**Define Matter:** Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space (volume).

**Define Mass:** Mass is the amount of matter in an object.

**Define Volume:** Volume is the amount of space an object takes up.



| Shape | Solids | Liquids | Gases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shape | Definite | Indefinite | Indefinite |
| Volume | Definite | Definite | Indefinite |
| Particles | Fixed (Uniform), Very Close, and move very slowly | Randomly arranged, close together, and move moderately fast | Randomly arranged, far apart, and move very fast |
| Examples | Ice, Rocks, Metals | Water, Oil, Honey | Steam, Air, Smoke |


What are the phase changes that matter undergoes?

**Phase Change:** A change from one state of matter to another.

**Melting:** The change from a solid to a liquid.

**Freezing:** The change from a liquid to a solid.

**Boiling:** The change from a liquid to a gas.

**Condensation:** The change from a gas to a liquid.

**Sublimation:** The change from a solid to a gas.

**Deposition:** The change from a gas to a solid.



Distinguish between exothermic and endothermic reactions:

Exothermic reactions release energy and the temperature on the thermometer increases. Hint: External

Endothermic reactions absorb energy and the temperature on the thermometer decreases. Hint: Internal

Identify the energy changes that occur during phase changes:

**Melting**: Endothermic

**Freezing**: Exothermic

**Boiling**: Endothermic

**Condensation**: Exothermic

**Sublimation**: Endothermic

**Deposition**: Exothermic

Analyze the energy changes that occur during phase changes:

**Melting**: Energy is absorbed by the solid and the temperature increases.

**Freezing**: Energy is released by the solid and the temperature decreases.

**Boiling**: Energy is absorbed by the liquid and the temperature increases.

**Condensation**: Energy is released by the gas and the temperature decreases.

**Sublimation**: Energy is absorbed by the solid and the temperature increases.

**Deposition**: Energy is released by the gas and the temperature decreases.
